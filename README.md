# Detection-of-images-Cancer-Histopathologic

- description:

This project focuses on accurately detecting and classifying cancer histological images. By leveraging advanced image recognition and deep learning techniques, the model plays a pivotal role in revolutionizing cancer diagnosis.

The primary goal of the project is to differentiate between “non-cancerous” and “cancerous” tissue samples based on their histological images. Histopathology involves examining microscopic tissue sections for abnormalities. Trained on a diverse and large-scale dataset, the model has learned to identify subtle patterns that indicate cancerous growth, providing doctors with a valuable tool for more accurate and efficient diagnosis.
